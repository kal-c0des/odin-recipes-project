    <h2>An iconic holiday food, turned even more iconic-er!</h2>
    <p>
      If I learned anything from Friends, it's that sticky magazine pages can
      lead to new and<br />
      interesting recipes! Rachel's English Trifle is one to remember. It's so
      good, even the<br />
      <em>birds</em> love it. Don't be like Chandler - if you eat in on the
      balcony, hold on to your plate<br />
      or they just might fly off with it and drop it in the street!
    </p>
    <p>
      Be prepared to call your friends to tell them how good it is (from your
      kid's room)..<br />
      Heck, take it in the bathroom so you can look at it while you eat it!<br />
      Wherever you decide to eat it, just enjoy!
