    <h3>A colorful spaghetti breakfast for the rambunctious sweet tooth!</h3>
    <p>
      If you've seen the movie "Elf", you'd know that elves love their sugar.
      They always try to<br />
      stick to the four main food groups: candy, candy canes, candy corn, and
      syrup.<br />
      This recipe covers two of the four!
    </p>

      Recreate this <em>memorable</em><br />
      scene and maybe you'll be bouncing with joy and energy just like Buddy!

    <h4>Recipe Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil spaghetti according to the instructions on the package or box,
        about 10 minutes.<br />
        (If you throw a noodle at the wall and it <em>sticks</em>, 'tis cooked
        to <em>perfection</em>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        When the pasta is close to being done, put the chocolate fudge Pop Tart
        in a toaster.<br />
        After it's toasted, set aside for later.
      </li>

      <li>
        Drain the spaghetti noodles in a collander and run cold water over the
        noodles to prevent over-cooking.
      </li>
      <li>Place desired amount of noodles on a clean dinner plate.</li>
      <li>
        Add your toppings: garnish your pasta with M&M's, rainbow sprinkles, and
        mini marshmallows.<br />
        Measure with love; the more the merrier (and sweeter)!
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle (or drench) your spaghetti with the chocolate and maple
        syrup.<br />
        Like it <strong><em>really</em></strong> sweet? Squeeze the bottles
        until empty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break the Pop Tart into two pieces and place along side your spaghetti.
        Consider this your toast!
